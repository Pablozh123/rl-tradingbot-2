Analysis:
- The 3-candle confirmation logic, while profitable in Jul-Dec (+8.88%), fails in Jan-Jun (-6.91%).
- Both Longs and Shorts are losing.
- Win rate is low (33%).
- This suggests the "Grind" definition or the EMA filter is too restrictive or ill-suited for the Jan-Jun market structure (which had a strong rally from 16k to 30k, but perhaps with more volatility that triggers the filters or stops).
